<div id="faq-what"></div>
<h3>What is CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p>We're a community of people learning web development. Study groups help us learn faster. </p>


<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What's the inspiration behind CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
                <p> The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn web development on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
                <p>I know because I've experienced all of these hiccups first-hand.</p>
                <p>What I've discovered since I started learning is that <em>people</em> -- mentors, co-workers, and study partners -- were key to accelerating my learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Who should join these study groups?</h3>
<p>Anyone can join as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to <em>be</em> or aspire to be a career programmer. Code literacy is for everyone.</p>

<div id="faq-help"></div>
<h3>How do I get help if I'm stuck on something?</h3>
<p>First, log it in your team worksheet -- other people might be encountering the same problem! Next, if you can't find the answer after searching online (e.g. Stackoverflow) or asking your team, you should send a message to the Google Group, where advisors or other people who may be at a slightly more advanced spot could answer your question.</p>
<p>CodeBuddies isn't meant to <em>replace</em> resources like Stackoverflow, Quora, and other online forums; we're huge fans of those sites. Our goal is simply to help you get un-stuck faster by connecting you with like-minded people who might more instantly understand what you're struggling with. </p>

<div id="faq-adv"></div>
<h3>Why do I need study groups if I can just find the answer on Stackoverflow?</h3>
                <p>Study groups also help you:
                <ol>
                    <li>Stay motivated enough to truly master the tutorial.</li>
                    <li>Get un-stuck faster, because other people know exactly what issue you're running into because they're working on the same tutorial. </li>
                    <li>Take advantage of a safe environment where you can ask questions you might hesitate to ask in a public forum.</li>
                    <li>Make connections and exchange helpful tips knowledge with peers who understand your background and skill level.</li>
                    <li>Validate your understanding of the material when you find yourself explaining concepts to others running into the same questions you once ran into. (The open-source community has a culture of being quite collaborative: get help, and helps others in turn!)</li></p>
                </ol>
                </p>

<div id="faq-time"></div>
<h3>What's the time commitment for each study group?</h3>
<p>Everyone's busy; we know that. Our expectation is that when you sign up to join a study group, you try your best to work through the tutorial by spending at least 15 minutes on it each week -- and logging what you learned (or what you got stuck on) in you progress tracker spreadsheet. The easiest way to fail out something is to stop working on it.
</p>
<p>
If you get stuck on something, please persist with it and also let other people know so they can help you! That's the best way to perservere at this.
</p>


<div id="faq-project"></div>
<h3>But I've heard that project-based learning is the best way to learn!</h3>
  <p>That may be true, but experience has taught us that it pays to study the "rules" first. </p>
  <p>Working on your personal projects in tandem with going through a more formal tutorial <em>can</em> be very helpful -- and we encourage you to share those personal projects with your team during your weekly check-ins and with the larger Google Group. </p>

<div id="faq-money"></div>
<h3>Is it free to join a study group?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. We try to </p>
